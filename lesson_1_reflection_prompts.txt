How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it much easier and quick, as well as clear

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps me to debug, find mistakes, and go back if my algorithm is not working as expected,
    or I want to go back and change the design of the web/app

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is that you don't end up with many useless files, it doesn't break your files
    in useless ununderstandable files, and it gets saved when you finish your work or you
    have to leave. The cons are that you can forget to save, if you forget to save and the
    computer goes down you lose your work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when coding, it is quite possible that two or more files are related when making
    changes, like a html file and a css file when adding a new element o removing some.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To know what changes were made in the files and the difference between two of them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Much more, now you can try a lot of things without messing it out

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Create a new website and see the changes I've made with different strategies
