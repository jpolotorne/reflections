When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I collaborate with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because other people might make changes and doing that, it may get broken or deleted

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  forks are clones of other github repositories on my github, clones are copies of repositories, branches are variations of your code.
  I'd use forks to copy other github repositories, clone to download repos and copy my own, and branch to fix bugs or add new features

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  To combine changes from you and from other people on the github repository
